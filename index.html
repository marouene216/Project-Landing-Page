        <h2>The Tour de France</h2>
        <p>The Tour de France is the world's biggest annual sporting event...</p>

        <p>  Nearly 200 cyclists race over 2,000 miles in just 23 days.
          
         It's normally held in July but delays brought about by the coronavirus pandemic have moved the Tour around a bit in recent years
          
          While most of the race takes part in the towns, cities, countryside and mountains of France it also often starts in a foreign country.
          
          And it's absolutely free to watch - you just have to get there early to beat the crowds and find a place to stand!
